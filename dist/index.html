“The anointing to teach had dropped inside of me.” To prove this gift out, he began to hold Wednesday afternoon teaching meetings. These meetings were so successful that people began to arrange their work schedules in order to attend. </li>
          <li><strong>1949 -</strong> Entered what was then called the field (traveling) ministry. While he was on the road, his meetings included healing services, but he primarily focused on teaching faith.</li>
          <li><strong>1950 -</strong> Heard an audible voice from God saying, “Go teach My people faith! I have taught you faith through My Word. I have permitted you to go through certain experiences, and you have learned faith, both through my Word and by experience. Now, go teach My people what I have taught you.” From that time on, Kenneth had an increased determination to teach faith in God’s Word.</li>
